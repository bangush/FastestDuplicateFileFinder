# FastestDuplicateFileFinder
Yet another duplicate file finder that's developed by KISS principle.

# Usage
Just drag and drop the folder you want to scan, to the executable file.
Or alternatively, you can specify a path from the command line.
```
FastestDuplicateFileFinder.exe D:\path\to\your\mom
```

# Extremely Fast
It can scan 2,072 files, which is roughly 10 GB, in less than two seconds on my poor Pentium Dual-Core E6800 @ 3.33 GHz. xxHash, the fastest non-cryptographic hashing algorithm that is out there, is supporting this little piece of code.
